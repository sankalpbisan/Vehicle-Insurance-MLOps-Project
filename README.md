# Vehicle Insurance MLOps Project

![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1500x500.png?text=Vehicle+Insurance+MLOps+Project)

This repository contains the implementation of an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for a vehicle insurance project. The goal of this project is to predict vehicle insurance claims using machine learning models, integrated with MLOps practices such as automated deployment, monitoring, and continuous integration.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The **Vehicle Insurance MLOps Project** aims to build and deploy machine learning models that can predict insurance claims for vehicles. The project follows best practices for model development, deployment, and monitoring in a real-world MLOps environment.

## üåü Features

- **Predictive Model**: Uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a vehicle insurance claim.
- **MLOps Pipeline**: Fully automated pipeline for continuous model training, testing, and deployment.
- **Model Monitoring**: Tools for tracking model performance and drift.
- **Data Processing**: Efficient ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to handle raw data.
- **Automated Deployment**: Deploy models automatically using CI/CD tools.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Leverages cloud technologies for easy scaling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python, Shell Scripting
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
- **MLOps Tools**: MLflow, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS (or specify other platforms you‚Äôre using)
- **Database/Storage**: PostgreSQL, AWS S3 (or specify your choice)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Other Tools**: Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration, DVC for data versioning

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sankalpbisan/Vehicle-Insurance-MLOps-Project.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd Vehicle-Insurance-MLOps-Project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Setup environment variables:

Ensure you have all the required environment variables set. You can use a `.env` file or set them directly.

Example `.env`:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
```

### 4. Run the project:

To start the project locally:

```bash
python app.py
```

### 5. Dockerize the application:

If you wish to run it in a containerized environment:

```bash
docker build -t vehicle-insurance .
docker run -p 5000:5000 vehicle-insurance
```

## üß† How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion**: Collect data from various sources (e.g., insurance claims, vehicle details, user profiles).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, normalize, and transform the data into a format suitable for model training.
3. **Model Development**: Train multiple machine learning models, tune hyperparameters, and select the best model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the model to a production environment using Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.
6. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor model performance to ensure accuracy and prevent data drift.

## ü§ñ Model Development

This project uses a combination of classical machine learning techniques and deep learning models to predict insurance claims. The models are evaluated and tuned to achieve the best performance based on validation data.

### Key Steps:
1. Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature engineering, scaling).
2. Model training using Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or other libraries.
3. Hyperparameter tuning and model selection.

For more details on how the models are developed and trained, check the `notebooks` and `src` directories.

## üö¢ Deployment

The model is deployed in a production-like environment using Docker and Kubernetes. CI/CD pipelines ensure that changes are automatically tested, validated, and deployed.

### Steps:
1. **Dockerize the Model**: Containerize the model using Docker.
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Configure Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
3. **Scalable Infrastructure**: Use Kubernetes to deploy and scale the model for production usage.

## üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

- **Model Monitoring**: Continuously track the model's performance and ensure it does not drift.
- **Performance Metrics**: Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring of the model's health.
- **Model Retraining**: Implement retraining pipelines to keep the model up-to-date.
